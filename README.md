# Love Reading

Love Reading is a site that promotes a dynamic book club which caters to people with different reading styles. It hopes to connect, motivate and inspire people to become literary lovers. This book club provides opportunities for members to better understand their reading styles and explore ways to not only digest powerful novels but learn how to bring the pages to life. 
The Love Reading site will be a perfect start for those who are ready to adopt a new lifestyle of reading. All readers who would like to join the club can find out about our different reading methods, locations and meeting times and how to become a member.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea that can be implemented to this site is testimonials from previous or present members who have participated in some of the reading sessions provided by Love Reading.

- An additional feature would be a link in the footer that takes the user to the communal blogging site mentioned in the literary session of the club ethos section.

- Furthermore, a book recommendations page could be added for members of the group to share suggestions of novels to read in future.

- In addition to this there could be a feature that allows members to create a Love Reading social media profile page where they could post their thoughts on their current reads, post their favourite novel quotes, connect and discuss with other club members.

## Testing 

According to light house testing my project meets main criteria.


In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.


### Validator Testing 

- HTML
  - No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?lang=en&profile=css3svg&uri=https%3A%2F%2Frhema28.github.io%2FProject-0%2Findex.html&usermedium=all&vextwarning=&warning=1)
  
- CSS

### Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed. 

## Deployment

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
