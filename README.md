# Love Reading

Love Reading is a site that promotes a dynamic book club which caters to people with different reading styles. It hopes to connect, motivate and inspire people to become literary lovers. This book club provides opportunities for members to better understand their reading styles and explore ways to not only digest powerful novels but learn how to bring the pages to life. 
The Love Reading site will be a perfect start for those who are ready to adopt a new lifestyle of reading. All readers who would like to join the club can find out about our different reading methods, locations and meeting times and how to become a member.

### Features Left to Implement

- Another feature idea that can be implemented to this site is testimonials from previous or present members who have participated in some of the reading sessions provided by Love Reading.

- An additional feature would be a link in the footer that takes the user to the communal blogging site mentioned in the literary session of the club ethos section.

- Furthermore, a book recommendations page could be added for members of the group to share suggestions of novels to read in future.

- In addition to this there could be a feature that allows members to create a Love Reading social media profile page where they could post their thoughts on their current reads, post their favourite novel quotes, connect and discuss with other club members.

## Testing 

According to light house testing my project meets the main criteria. However, my initial performance score was 65%. After discussing this with my mentor, we concluded that this was as a result of the size of my hero image 1. He suggested that I compress the image using 

[CompressJpeg](https://compressjpeg.com/).

I did this and also compressed my hero image 2. After both images were compressed, my score went up to 85%

My accessibility score was at 92% initially as I had a problem with the color contrast. So I had to darken the font color of my menu and body text so that users who may suffer from color blindness would be able to read the content clearly and with ease. This brought my score to 100%.
